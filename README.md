# The Blockchain Vault (TBV)

The Blockchain Vault (TBV) is a project designed to create a blockchain-based master data store. It utilizes a blockchain transaction store to log and apply changes to an RDF or graph store, providing an auditable trail for the state of the graph store. By using an RDF graph store instead of a traditional relational database (RDBMS), TBV allows for dynamic data representation, where different schemas can be applied at query time, providing a flexible view of the data.

## Features
- **Blockchain-Based Transactions**: Ensures data integrity and traceability through an immutable audit trail.
- **RDF Graph Store Integration**: Allows for dynamic schemas, enabling flexible and varied data views.
- **Master Data Store**: Provides a secure and consistent single source of truth for the data.

## Requirements
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (package manager for Rust)

## Getting Started
To get started with The Blockchain Vault, follow the steps below to set up your environment and run the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-blockchain-vault.git
$ cd the-blockchain-vault
```

### 2. Build the Project
Use Cargo, Rust's package manager, to build the project:
```bash
$ cargo build
```

### 3. Run the Project
Once the build completes, you can run the project with:
```bash
$ cargo run
```

### 4. Run Tests
To verify that everything is working correctly, run the tests using:
```bash
$ cargo test
```

## Usage
The Blockchain Vault is designed to provide a flexible way to manage and query data with different schemas. Once the project is running, you can interact with the blockchain transaction store, making changes to the RDF graph store and querying the current state of the data.
